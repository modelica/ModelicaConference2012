The 9th International Modelica Conference will be held at the Veranstaltungsforum Fürstenfeld (Fürstenfeld Convention Center) in Munich, Germany on September 3 - 5, 2012. It is organized by the [Modelica Association](https://modelica.org/association) and [DLR - Robotics and Mechatronics Center](http://www.dlr.de/rm/en).

The Modelica Conference is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and language designers to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to [Modelica](https://modelica.org) and to the [Functional Mockup Interface](http://www.fmi-standard.org/). The program will cover modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems, as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial applications. All contributions are peer-reviewed and selected by the Program Committee. In addition to traditional paper presentations and poster sessions, the conference features several Modelica tutorials for beginners and advanced users, as well as vendor presentations, and an exhibition. The last Modelica conference in 2011 was visited by 325 participants from 23 countries, and we expect a similar size at this conference.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Munich.

# Exhibition and Sponsoring

A [commercial exhibition](sponsors.md) will be arranged in conjunction to the conference. The exhibition will take place at Matteannexet at Lund University. The commercial exhibition will be integrated with the session halls, poster exhibition and the catering services and will thus be an excellent exhibition window towards the expected 300-400 delegates.

The exhibition will be open during conference hours, 11-12 March 2014. Build-up will take place 10 March from 07.00. Please note that heavy goods can only be delivered between 07.00-08.00 in the morning or 13.00-14.00 in the afternoon due to exams in the building. Therefore no noise is possible outside these hours.

The program structure will make time for the participants to visit your stand. This means that there are excellent opportunities for dialogue between exhibitors and conference participants.
